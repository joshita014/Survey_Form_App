## Survey Form App <br>

Hi , I am Joshita Gautam. This is my MERN Project for Evotech Global company. <br>
Here I have setup a Node.js and Express server using MongoDB to store survey form submissions.<br>
Implemented RESTful API endpoints for handling surveys form submissions,I have developed a React application to interact with the backend(Nodejs).<br>
And Designed a survey form with fields such as name, gender, nationality, email, phone number, address, and
message. <br>
Also Implement form submission functionality, storing the data in the MongoDB database. Design a page to view the data from a list of previous survey form submissions. <br>
Here I have allowed admin to have a login access to view the data from a list of previous survey form submissions.<br>

## lOGIN ID AND PASSWORD<br>

ID - admin <br>
Password - admin123<br>
